# toolarium-icap-client fork 

Implements an ICAP client in java compliant with [RFC 3507](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3507.txt)

In addition to the original client at Toolarium, this fork uses the Quarkus framework and Testcontainers and is 
mostly meant as an example implementation and prove of concept of those frameworks.
